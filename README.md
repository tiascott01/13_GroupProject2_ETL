## Overview

This repository contains a two correlating files ('part_1_mars_news.ipynb' and 'part_2_mars_news.ipynb') with an exported CSV file ('mars_data_export.csv') for analyzing and summarizing data that was scraped from a website. The directions for the module were to scrape data from a website to pull data into a jupyter file, create data and charts against the imported data, and export the findings into a csv.

Additionally, the file also has several factors I wish to address here. First, I did not use the basic colors from the notebook when creating my graphs. I instead used specific tones of green, yellow, blue, pink, and red. This was intentional. These are the same hues from my previous homeworks and I believe it's a better representation of different datasets than plotting all the charts in the same original plot colors. I realize this is a full portfolio of work and I would like my portfolio to show a congruent use of colors and styles across each of my pieces where possible.

## Results

In the 11_WebScraping_Challenge, the first dataset is an scraping from a mars website including title and preview text. The notebook appends data from the website into a more manageable list format which shows the lists in fill from the website. In the second file, another scraping from a separate website collects data about the temperature, date, pressure, and other weather conditions from the location of the Curiosity rover. The data chain continues importing the data and setting into a dataframe for further analysis and graphing. To make sure the data is calculated appropriately, several columns must adhere convert to specific datatypes and are changed to reflect the new type. Several graphs have been calculated against as well as an analysis after each graph answering varying questions about conditions on Mars. A final output of the data is saved in a csv file for future use.

## Usage

You can use this file to analyze the data in the corresponding notebook.

1. Open the respective file (`part_1_mars_news.ipynb') in Jupyter Notebook or VSCode.

2. Make sure that the resource and analysis directories are congruent within their respective places as listed in the script, if not change the location.
   
3. Cells requiring the dependencies such as BeautifulSoup and Selenium must be imported prior to use.

5. Run individual cells within the (`part_1_mars_news.ipynb') to see the calculations or breakdown by category.
